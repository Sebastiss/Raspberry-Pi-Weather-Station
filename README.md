## Features
List of features which I want to develop
To-do list:
* Recognition by the image she condition
* Read data from the sensors and represnets values on a web-site
* Get notification about sky condtion
* Sky image recognition using OpenCV and RPi Camera Module
* Read and store data form the sensors
* Represent store data on a web-site

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
